Fix this

fix ctrl + \
cat alone -> ctrl C -> should print only one minishell (is printing 2)
Set PATH to multiple directory and ensure the directories are checked from left to right

fix cat | cat | ls


to do 13.05
- cat >> 1 adds minishell to the file 1, why? we need to change it
- execuite all pipes at the same time cat | cat | ls
- we get doble minishell in some cases
- we are not sure if heredoc is the correct implementation
- cat << abc is not working


check
- cat >> abc must have 3 signals including ctrl + \
