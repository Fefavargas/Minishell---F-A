TO DO:

Done:
- we get doble minishell in some cases
- cat alone -> ctrl C -> should print only one minishell (is printing 2)
- fix cat << abc, it is not printing the result - heredoc works
- sleep 2 | sleep 2 | sleep 2 | sleep 2 | sleep 2 -> parallel execution. The fix is a while loop, Find out
how many commands will be piped, then do a while loop for that number - 1, and then execute. 2D array
- cat << abc \n test1 \n test2 \n ctrl D -> should return error and print what is in the buffer
- fix ctrl + \
- cat | cat | ls
- cat >> 1 adds minishell to the file 1, why? we need to change it
- cat << a -> ctrl D -> should print and exit, idelly show a warning
- cat << a -> ctrl D -> should cancel


to do 13.05
