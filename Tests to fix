TO DO:

Done:
- we get doble minishell in some cases
- cat alone -> ctrl C -> should print only one minishell (is printing 2)
- fix cat << abc, it is not printing the result - heredoc works
- sleep 2 | sleep 2 | sleep 2 | sleep 2 | sleep 2 -> parallel execution. The fix is a while loop, Find out
how many commands will be piped, then do a while loop for that number - 1, and then execute. 2D array
- cat << abc \n test1 \n test2 \n ctrl D -> should return error and print what is in the buffer
- fix ctrl + \
- cat | cat | ls
- cat >> 1 adds minishell to the file 1, why? we need to change it
- cat << a -> ctrl D -> should print and exit, idelly show a warning
- cat << a -> ctrl D -> should cancel
- Ctrl C change the exit code
- run command that doesnt exist, then do exit, then in bash do echo $?, it should be 127 not 0.


to do 13.05
- Set PATH to multiple directory and ensure the directories are checked from left to right
- Bin/ cd .. -> here we have an error simiar to bash, only that we say command not found and bash says no such file or directory
- Echo “‘$HOME’”
- Echo $HO-ME
- Cat << hello
Fhabfk
Shdjd
Ctrl \
Should not update exit code
- run command that doesn't exist, then exit. Then echo $? Should say 127 not 0
- << 1 -> seg fault and should generate the file 1
- Export AAA
- Ech”o” hello
- Echo $USER$HOME
